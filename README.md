# Secure Digital Building Permit System (SDBPS)

A blockchain-based solution for transparent, efficient, and secure management of the building permit process.

## Overview

The Secure Digital Building Permit System (SDBPS) leverages blockchain technology to modernize and streamline the construction permitting process. By creating an immutable, transparent record of property ownership, contractor qualifications, inspections, and permit issuance, this system reduces fraud, improves efficiency, and ensures compliance with building codes and zoning regulations.

## System Architecture

The SDBPS consists of four primary smart contracts:

1. **Property Verification Contract**
    - Validates property ownership records
    - Confirms zoning compliance and land use regulations
    - Interfaces with existing land registry databases
    - Verifies property boundaries and setback requirements

2. **Contractor Licensing Contract**
    - Verifies and tracks contractor credentials and qualifications
    - Manages contractor licensing status and history
    - Records specializations and certification levels
    - Tracks insurance and bonding requirements

3. **Inspection Scheduling Contract**
    - Manages scheduling and verification of construction phase inspections
    - Records inspection results with tamper-proof documentation
    - Facilitates inspector assignment and qualification verification
    - Tracks construction progress through required inspection milestones

4. **Permit Issuance Contract**
    - Records and validates approved building permits
    - Maintains complete history of permit applications and modifications
    - Tracks permit status through the approval process
    - Manages permit fees and payment verification

## Key Features

- **Transparency**: All stakeholders have appropriate visibility into the permit process
- **Fraud Prevention**: Immutable records prevent document forgery and unauthorized modifications
- **Process Efficiency**: Automated verification reduces processing time and administrative burden
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built-in checks ensure adherence to local building codes and regulations
- **Interoperability**: Designed to integrate with existing municipal systems and databases

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16+
- Truffle framework
- Ganache (for local development)
- Web3.js
- Metamask or similar Ethereum wallet

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/sdbps.git
   cd sdbps
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile the smart contracts:
   ```
   truffle compile
   ```

4. Deploy to local development blockchain:
   ```
   truffle migrate --network development
   ```

### Configuration

1. Configure the network settings in `truffle-config.js` for your target deployment network
2. Set up environment variables for API keys and municipal database connections
3. Configure local zoning and building code parameters in `config/regulations.json`

## Usage

### For Property Owners

```javascript
// Example: Verifying property ownership
const propertyContract = await PropertyVerification.deployed();
await propertyContract.verifyOwnership(propertyId, ownerAddress, documentHash);

// Example: Submitting permit application
const permitContract = await PermitIssuance.deployed();
await permitContract.submitApplication(propertyId, projectType, constructionDetails, plannedStartDate);
```

### For Contractors

```javascript
// Example: Registering contractor credentials
const contractorContract = await ContractorLicensing.deployed();
await contractorContract.registerContractor(licenseNumber, credentials, specializations, insuranceProof);

// Example: Requesting inspection
const inspectionContract = await InspectionScheduling.deployed();
await inspectionContract.requestInspection(permitId, inspectionType, proposedDateRange);
```

### For Municipal Authorities

```javascript
// Example: Approving permit application
const permitContract = await PermitIssuance.deployed();
await permitContract.approvePermit(applicationId, reviewerNotes, expirationDate, approverAddress);

// Example: Recording inspection results
const inspectionContract = await InspectionScheduling.deployed();
await inspectionContract.recordInspectionResults(inspectionId, status, findings, inspectorId, documentationHash);
```

## Security Considerations

- **Access Control**: Granular permissions system to ensure appropriate action authorization
- **Document Hashing**: Cryptographic verification of submitted documents
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all system interactions
- **Smart Contract Auditing**: Regular security audits recommended
- **Key Management**: Secure handling of private keys for different stakeholders

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify contract functionality:

```
truffle test
```

Test coverage includes:
- Property verification workflows
- Contractor licensing validation
- Inspection scheduling and result recording
- Permit application and issuance processes

## Deployment

### Testnet Deployment

For testing on Ethereum testnets:

```
truffle migrate --network goerli
```

### Production Deployment

For deploying to production networks:

```
truffle migrate --network mainnet
```

## Frontend Integration

A complementary web application provides user-friendly access for all stakeholders:

- Property owners can track permit applications
- Contractors can manage licensing and inspection scheduling
- Municipal officials can process applications and record inspections
- Public users can verify permit validity and contractor credentials

## Integration APIs

RESTful APIs are available for integration with:
- Existing municipal permitting systems
- GIS and mapping services
- Document management systems
- Payment processing services
